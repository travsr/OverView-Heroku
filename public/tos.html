                These terms of use and our Privacy Policy, which is incorporated herein by reference (collectively, “Terms of Use”), govern the relationship between you and OverView, and affiliates (collectively, “OverView” or “we” or “us”) relating in any way to your use of any online or mobile product or service to which you have access, any product or service that requires an internet connection or OverView Account to access, install, use, or play, any OverView Account you use to access online or mobile products or services, and any service accessible from an OverView webpage (collectively, the “OverView Services”) offered by OverView.  Each OverView Service may have its own specific Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, and if you download, access, or use an OverView Service, you agree to also be bound by its specific Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.

            <div class="spacer5"></div>

            Some OverView Services are available for download from mobile application platform providers like Google or Apple, each of which may require you to maintain an account with them in order to access and use OverView Services.

            You are solely responsible for your interactions with other users with whom you interact through OverView Services you access. OverView reserves the right, but has no obligation, to become involved in any way with any disputes concerning OverView Services.  You will fully cooperate with us to investigate any suspected unlawful, fraudulent or improper activity, including without limitation granting OverView access to any portion of your account.

            <div class="spacer5"></div>

            If you have a dispute with one or more users, or any other interaction you believe may give rise to any claim, you release OverView (and our officers, directors, agents, subsidiaries, joint ventures and employees) from claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes.

            <div class="spacer5"></div>

            <strong>If you live in California, you waive California Civil Code §1542, which says: "A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him or her must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor."</strong>

            <div class="spacer5"></div>

            <strong>If you live outside of California, you waive any other statute, law, or rule of similar effect in your jurisdiction.</strong>

            OverView Services may include features by which users can submit or upload content to OverView Services, including without limitation chat and messaging utilities and the ability to select profile names and names for certain In-Service Content (collectively, “User Content”).  If you create an OverView Services account via a Third Party Service or otherwise “link” content associated with your Third Party Service account to your account for OverView Services, your User Content includes any information or content provided to us by that Third Party Service.  You represent that you have all rights and permissions necessary to submit User Content to us (including, with respect to photographs, written consent from each identifiable person therein), that your User Content is accurate, and that your User Content is not subject to any confidentiality obligations or in violation of the Code of Conduct.  In addition, you represent and warrant that any User Content submitted by you does not violate or infringe upon any copyright, right of privacy, trademark, patent, trade-name, performing right or any literary, dramatic, musical, athletic, personal, private, civil, contract, or property right or any other right of any person, firm, or corporation, or contain any libelous or slanderous material.

            <div class="spacer5"></div>

            You retain all right, title and interest to your User Content, except that you grant us a perpetual, non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, irrevocable, worldwide license to use your User Content and any modifications thereto in connection with OverView Services without compensation to you.  To the extent permitted by applicable law, you waive any moral rights you may have in your User Content (such as the right to be identified as the author).

            <div class="spacer5"></div>

            We do not endorse any User Content supplied by other users; each user is responsible for his or her User Content, and we expressly disclaim any warranty with respect to User Content.  We have no obligation to monitor User Content, and we are not responsible for monitoring OverView Services for inappropriate or illegal communications by other users.

            <h3>9. Information Collection and Use; Privacy Policy</h3>

            In addition to User Content, OverView collects (i) information, content or other material that you provide to us or is otherwise transmitted in or through OverView Services you access or which is generated, acquired or developed when you download, install, and/or use OverView Services or anytime you are in contact with us and (ii) information you receive or which is transmitted to or otherwise made available to you from other users of OverView Services or third parties in OverView Services (collectively, “Service Information”).  We use the Service Information in many ways, including but not limited to, to help us provide and support OverView Services and our services.  For example, we may use the Service Information to deliver and target advertising and generate information about the reach and effectiveness of advertising through various measurements and analytics (without providing personally identifiable information about you).

            <h3>10. In-Game Items; Payments; Ownership</h3>

            OverView Services may allow you to “earn” In-Service Content.  You may also use real money to purchase a license to use certain In-Service Content.  Purchased In-Service Content is subject to the payment terms and conditions of the mobile platform (e.g., Apple’s iOS, Google’s Android OS, and Amazon’s Fire OS) from which you make your purchase.  OverView does not control or manage the payment process; please review the relevant terms and conditions with the applicable platform provider before making any In-App Purchases.  When you purchase a license to use In-Service Content, you agree that we may begin to supply you with your purchased In-Service Content immediately.

            <div class="spacer5"></div>

            Unless otherwise specified, you agree that you have no ownership interest in your OverView Account or any In-Service Content associated with your account, regardless of whether you “earned” or “purchased” such In-Service Content.  You agree that In-Service Content, including “Gold,” “Silver,” and any other virtual currencies or goods within OverView Services are for personal non-commercial entertainment purposes, have no independent value outside of OverView Services, may not be redeemed for any cash value, and is simply a measurement of your limited license.

            <div class="spacer5"></div>

            <strong>ALL SALES ARE FINAL.</strong> YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT NEITHER WE NOR ANY MOBILE PLATFORM PROVIDER IS REQUIRED TO PROVIDE A REFUND FOR ANY REASON, AND THAT YOU WILL NOT RECEIVE MONEY OR OTHER COMPENSATION FOR UNUSED IN-SERVICE CONTENT WHEN AN ACCOUNT IS CLOSED, WHETHER SUCH CLOSURE WAS VOLUNTARY OR INVOLUNTARY, UNLESS OTHERWISE REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  IN THE EVENT THAT YOU DO NOT RECEIVE AN IN-SERVICE ITEM THAT YOU PROPERLY PURCHASED THROUGH A PLATFORM PROVIDER, YOU MAY REQUEST A REFUND DIRECTLY FROM THAT PLATFORM PROVIDER SUBJECT TO THEIR REFUND POLICY.

            <h3>11. Termination and Suspension</h3>

            You may terminate your OverView Account at any time, for any reason or no reason, by issuing an in-Service message or by sending an email to <a class="maillink" href="mailto:support@OverView.com">support@OverView.com</a> with the subject entitled “Termination.”

            <div class="spacer5"></div>

            We reserve the right to suspend or discontinue OverView Services or any part of them at any time, including any features, game elements and In-Service Content and revoke any and all licenses provided to you under these Terms of Use.  If that happens, we are not required to provide refunds, benefits or other compensation to you for discontinued elements of OverView Services or for any In-Service Content previously earned or purchased, and you will have no further right to access your account or use OverView Services.  WE MAY, IN OUR SOLE DISCRETION, LIMIT, SUSPEND, TERMINATE, MODIFY, OR DELETE ACCOUNTS OR ACCESS TO OverView SERVICES OR ANY PORTION OF THEM, AND PROHIBIT ACCESS TO OverView SERVICES AND THE CONTENT, SERVICES AND TOOLS AVAILABLE THROUGH OverView SERVICES, OR DELAY OR REMOVE USER CONTENT, AND WE ARE UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO COMPENSATE YOU FOR ANY LOSSES OR RESULTS.

            <div class="spacer5"></div>

            <h3>12. Disclaimer; Limitation of Liability</h3>

            OverView SERVICES ARE PROVIDED "AS IS," AND USE OF OverView SERVICES IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK.  TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, WE MAKE NO REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ABOUT OverView SERVICES OR ANY CONTENT OR SERVICES MADE AVAILABLE THROUGH OverView SERVICES, AND WE SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIM ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, OR AVAILABILITY.

            <div class="spacer5"></div>

            YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT, EXCEPT IN THE CASE OF WILLFUL ACTS OR GROSS NEGLIGENCE, WE WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR: (1) ANY INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, SPECIAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, REGARDLESS OF THE CAUSE OF ACTION AND EVEN IF WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES; (2) AN AMOUNT IN EXCESS OF $100 OR THE AMOUNTS YOU HAVE PAID US FOR OverView SERVICES DURING THE 6 MONTH PERIOD PRECEDING THE EVENT FIRST GIVING RISE TO LIABILITY, WHICHEVER IS GREATER; OR (3) THE CONDUCT OF THIRD PARTIES, INCLUDING THIRD PARTY SITES OR MOBILE PLATFORM PROVIDERS OR OTHER USERS OF OverView SERVICES.  Certain state and national laws do not allow some of the exclusion of liability or the warranty disclaimers set forth above.  Therefore, the above limitations and disclaimers may not apply to you, and you may have additional rights.

            <h3>13. Indemnity</h3>

            If you misuse OverView Services, violate the law, or violate these Terms of Use, and your violation results in loss or damage or a claim or liability against us, you agree to indemnify, defend and hold us harmless from (which means you agree to compensate us for) that loss, damage, claim or liability, including our legal fees and expenses.  We may take exclusive charge of the defense of any legal action for which you are required to indemnify us under this Section, at your expense.

            <h3>14. Agreement to Arbitrate; Class Action Waiver</h3>

            <h4 class="italic">PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY.  IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS AND INCLUDES WAIVER OF A TRIAL BY JURY IN A COURT AND OF THE ABILITY TO BRING ANY CLAIM ON BEHALF OF OTHERS.</h4>

            <div class="spacer10"></div>

            <h4>Overview</h4>

            This Section 14 (i.e., the “Agreement to Arbitrate”) applies to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law.  If the laws of your jurisdiction prohibit the application of provisions of this Section 14 notwithstanding Section 15 below, those prohibited provisions will not apply to you.  IF YOU LIVE IN THE EUROPEAN UNION, NONE OF THIS SECTION 14 APPLIES TO YOU.

            <div class="spacer5"></div>

            In the event of any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to these Terms, including any question regarding its existence, validity, termination or breach thereof, the parties hereto shall consult and negotiate with each other and, recognizing their mutual interests, attempt to reach a satisfactory solution. Most user concerns can be resolved by contacting our customer support team at <a class="maillink" href="mailto:support@OverView.com">support@OverView.com</a>. In the unlikely event that we are unable to resolve your concerns and a dispute remains, this Section explains how you and we agree to resolve it.  As explained in more detail below, <strong>we each agree to resolve any dispute between us through binding arbitration or small claims court instead of in courts of general jurisdiction.</strong>

            <div class="spacer10"></div>

            <h4>Agreement to Arbitrate; Exceptions</h4>

            If we cannot resolve our dispute through customer support, <strong>YOU AND WE AGREE TO RESOLVE ALL DISPUTES AND CLAIMS BETWEEN US IN INDIVIDUAL BINDING ARBITRATION, INCLUDING CLAIMS CONCERNING ANY ASPECT OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN US, YOUR DECISION TO DOWNLOAD OR ACCESS AN OverView SERVICE, YOUR USE OF AN OverView SERVICE, ANY USER CONTENT, OR YOUR ACCOUNT.</strong> This Agreement to Arbitrate is intended to be interpreted broadly, and applies to all legal claims under any legal theory (whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory), and applies to any disputes or claims that you assert or that arise even after you stop using or delete your OverView Account for an OverView Service, stop using an OverView Service, or delete an OverView Service application from your mobile device.  This Agreement to Arbitrate also applies to any claims that are currently the subject of a purported class action litigation in which you are not a member of a certified class.  You and we agree that the arbitrator shall have the exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability or enforceability of the terms or formation of this contract, including whether any dispute between us is subject to this Agreement to Arbitrate (i.e., the arbitrator will decide the arbitrability of any dispute) and whether all or any part of these terms are void or voidable.

            <div class="spacer5"></div>

            An arbitration is a proceeding before a neutral arbitrator, instead of before a judge or jury.  Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court, and provides more limited discovery.  It follows different rules than court proceedings, and is subject to very limited review by courts.  The arbitrator will issue a written decision and provide a statement of reasons if requested by either party. <strong>YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU AND WE ARE GIVING UP THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND THE RIGHT TO HAVE A TRIAL BEFORE A JUDGE OR JURY.</strong>

            <div class="spacer5"></div>

            This Section 14, however, <u>does not apply</u> to the following types of claims or disputes, which you or we may bring in court in accordance with Section 15 below:

            <div class="spacer5"></div>

            <strong>(1)</strong> claims of infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights, including such claims seeking injunctive relief; and

            <div class="spacer5"></div>

            <strong>(2)</strong> claims for preliminary injunctive relief for violations of sections 4 and 6 herein.

            <div class="spacer5"></div>

            This Section does not prevent you from bringing your dispute to the attention of any federal, state, or local government agencies that can, if the law allows, seek relief from us for you.  Also, any of us can bring a claim in small claims court either in Santa Clara County, California or the county where you live, or some other place we both agree on, if such claims meets all the requirements to be brought in that court.

            <div class="spacer5"></div>

            The Federal Arbitration Act applies to this Section 14.  The arbitration will be governed by the Consumer Arbitration Rules (the “Rules”) of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) (including Rule 1(g) of those Rules that provides for arbitration through the submission of documents only/desk arbitration where no disclosed claims or counterclaims exceed $25,000), as modified by these Terms of Use, The Rules are available at <a href="http://www.adr.org/">www.adr.org</a>. The arbitrator will be bound by these Terms of Use.

            <div class="spacer5"></div>

            <i>To start an arbitration proceeding, use the form on AAA’s website (<a href="http://www.adr.org/">www.adr.org</a>) or call the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.</i>

            <div class="spacer5"></div>

            Any arbitration under this section that is required to take place in person will take place pursuant to the Rules, which provide that face-to-face proceedings be conducted at a location which is reasonably convenient to both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances.

            <div class="spacer5"></div>

            If your claim is for US$25,000 or less, we agree to reimburse your filing fee promptly upon being notified of the filing, or pay it for you if you are unable to pay it and we receive a written request from you.  Also, if your claim is for US$25,000 or less, we agree to reimburse your share of the arbitration costs, including your share of arbitrator compensation, at the conclusion of the proceeding, unless the arbitrator determines your claims are frivolous or your costs are unreasonable as determined by the arbitrator.  If you seek more than US$25,000, the arbitration costs, including arbitrator compensation, will be split between you and us according to the Rules.  Irrespective of the amount you seek, neither party shall be entitled to have their attorneys’ fees or costs paid by the other party, provided, however, that either party may seek to recover their attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration if the arbitrator determines that the other party's claims (or counterclaims) are frivolous or the other party's costs are unreasonable.

THE ARBITRATOR CANNOT COMBINE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIM INTO A SINGLE CASE, AND CANNOT PRESIDE OVER ANY CONSOLIDATED, CLASS, OR REPRESENTATIVE ARBITRATION PROCEEDING, UNLESS WE BOTH AGREE OTHERWISE IN WRITING.  THE ARBITRATOR’S DECISION OR AWARD IN ONE PERSON’S CASE CAN ONLY AFFECT THE PERSON WHO BROUGHT THE CLAIM, NOT OTHER USERS OF OverView SERVICES, AND CANNOT BE USED TO DECIDE DISPUTES WITH OTHERS.</strong>

            <div class="spacer5"></div>

            <h3>18. Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA“) Notice</h3>

            OverView responds to allegations of copyright violations in accordance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”).  The DMCA provides a process for a copyright owner to give notification to an online service provider concerning alleged copyright infringement.  When OverView receives a valid DMCA notification, it may expeditiously take down the offending content.  On taking down content under the DMCA, we will take reasonable steps to contact the owner of the removed content, including by forwarding them a copy of the Notice and the name and email address of the person submitting the Notice, so that a Counter Notice may be filed.  On receiving a valid Counter Notice, we generally restore the content in question, unless we receive notice from the notification provider that a legal action has been filed seeking a court order to restrain the alleged infringer from engaging in the infringing activity.

            <div class="spacer5"></div>

            <i>Please note: The DMCA provides that you may be liable for damages (including costs and attorneys’ fees) if you falsely claim that content is infringing your copyright.  We recommend contacting an attorney if you are unsure whether your content is protected by copyright law or whether content is infringing on your copyright.</i>

            <div class="spacer10"></div>

            <h4>To Submit a Notice:</h4>

                <li>A physical signature of the copyright owner or a person authorized to act on their behalf.  To satisfy the signature requirement, please designate electronic signatures by typing a forward slash before and after your name (e.g., /Jane Doe/).</li>
